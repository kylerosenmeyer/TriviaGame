# TriviaGame
Coding Bootcamp HW5 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Guess Who Made That Law** is a trivia game designed by Kyle Rosenmeyer. The object is to guess all questions right, and call out the creator if he's making it up!

This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript *objects* and on-the-fly dom manipulation. This game is coded as an object and is 100% created on the fly.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
